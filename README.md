# advanced data structure
This project aims to build several advanced data structures that are covered in lecture. Topic includes b+ tree, interval tree, seqment tree, kd-tree, etc.

Throughout the project, we will build on top of C++ STL, and hopefully learn some concepts like template, class, etc.
